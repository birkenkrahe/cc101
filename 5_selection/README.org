* README

  - In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
    turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions
 
  - This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
    chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008).

* Preamble

- *Algorithms* are the core of programming

- Example for an algorithm: /"When you come to a STOP sign, stop."/

- The human form of algorithm is *heuristics*

- Example for a heuristic: /"To get to the college, go straight."/

- For *programming*, you need both algorithms and heuristics

- Useful tools to master when designing algorithms:
  - *Pseudocode* (task flow description)
  - *Visual modeling* (task flow visualization)

* Operators in C

  - Mathematically, operators are really functions: ~f(i,j)=i+j~

  - C has many operators, both unary (~-1~) and binary (~1+1~)

  - Types of operators in C:

    | OPERATOR            | WHY                   | EXAMPLES  | EXPRESSION |
    |---------------------+-----------------------+-----------+------------|
    | Arithmetic          | compute               | * + - / % | i * j + k  |
    | Relational          | compare               | < > <= >= | i > j      |
    | Equality            | compare (in/equality) | == !=       | i == j     |
    | Logical             | confirm (truth)       | &&        | i && j     |
    | Assignment          | change                | =         | i = j      |
    | Increment/decrement | change stepwise       | ++, +-    | ++i        |

  - Conditional operators used in C are important for program flow:

    | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION              | EXPRESSION | BOOLEAN VALUE |
    |----------+--------------------------+------------+---------------|
    | ==       | Equal                    | 5 == 5     | true          |
    | !=       | Not equal                | 5 != 5     | false         |
    | >        | Greater than             | 5 > 5      | false         |
    | <        | Less than                | 5 < 5      | false         |
    | >=       | Greater than or equal to | 5 >= 5     | true          |
    | <=       | Less than or equal to    | 5 <= 5     | true          |

  - The value of an evaluated conditional operator is *Boolean*
    (logical) - e.g. ~2==2~ evaluates as ~TRUE~ or ~1~.

* Operators in other languages

 - Different programming languages differ greatly rgd. operators. For
   example, in the language R, the ~|>~ operator ("pipe") passes a data
   set to a function[fn:6].

    #+begin_example R
    ## pipe data set into function
    mtcars |> head()  ## same as head(mtcars)
    #+end_example

    Output:    
    #+begin_example
               mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1

    #+end_example

 - You met the ~>~ operator of the ~bash~ shell language that redirects
   standard output to a file:

   #+begin_example bash
     ## create empty file called "empty"
     > empty
   #+end_example
   
* Pseudocode
** Overview

- *Pseudocode* is a method to write down/analyze an /algorithm/ or a
  /heuristic/ without having to bother with /syntax/

- The prefix pseudo- comes from Ancient Greek [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%88%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B4%CE%AE%CF%82][ψευδής]], meaning
  "lying", "false" or "untrue", as in "pseudoscience" or "pseudonym"

- Pseudocode does not need to compile or run so it is closer to a
  heuristic than to an exact algorithm.

- Code however needs to be exact and is always algorithmic

** Example

   - Example: player problem statement in [[problem1]] below:

     #+name: problem1
     #+begin_quote
     "Drink a health potion when a character's health is 100 or
     less. If health reaches 100 or more, resume battle."
     #+end_quote

   - Given the problem [[problem1]], this is the pseudocode [[pseudocode1]][fn:1]:

     #+name: pseudocode1
     #+begin_example C
     if health is less than 100
       Drink health potion
     else
       Resume battle
     end if
     #+end_example

   - The code in [[pseudocode1]] would not compile as a C program (you can
     test yourself: which mistakes would the compiler find?[fn:2])

   - The conceptual "trick" with generating pseudocode from a prose
     description is to identify the *logical condition* so that you can
     perform a comparison (= apply a *conditional operator*)

   - The pseudocode [[pseudocode1]] leads to the condition ~health < 100~:

     #+name: pseudocode11
     #+begin_example C
     if health < 100
       Drink health potion
     else
       Resume battle
     end if
     #+end_example

   - Notice that you could also use another operator: ~>=~ This operator
     would have had the same effect but it is not what you were
     supposed to code.

     #+name: pseudocode12
     #+begin_example C
     if health >= 100
       Resume battle       
     else
       Drink health potion
     end if
     #+end_example
     
   - *Rule:* when making models (via *abstraction*), always stay as close
     to the problem description as possible - in terms of language,
     logic, tone, etc. If you're unsure, ask.

* Process models
** Overview

- Flowcharts are popular among computing analysts and programmers

- Flowcharts are a special case of *process models*

- Process modeling is a key 21st century skill, because process is the
  central paradigm of modern work organization

- Rather than use flowcharts, we use BPMN - Business Process Model and
  Notation - see figure [[bpmnfig]] below for an overview of the whole
  language (you can get this poster at [[https://www.signavio.com/downloads/short-reads/free-bpmn-2-0-poster/][SAP Signavio]]).

  #+name: bpmnfig

** SAP Signavio

- [[https://signavio.com][SAP Signavio]] is a state-of-the-art process modeling environment

- It includes process mining and workflow management tools. The figure
  [[signavio]] below shows the app dashboard.

** Points to remember

   * Every model needs a pool = process owner
   * Conditions become gateways
   * Use active sentences for tasks
   * When the flow is split, it must be rejoined
   * All elements must be named
   * Do not change the size of elements
   * All elements can be "overloaded"

** BPMN elements

   * Roles (pools, lanes, participants)
   * Tasks (things to do)
   * Events (status)
   * Flow (between tasks or events)
   * Gateways (decision points, condition check)

** Let's practice

Download the [raw] Org-mode file ~bpmn.org~ from GitHub:

#+begin_src bash
  wget tinyurl.com/58mw8wuc -O bpmn.org -o log
  file bpmn.org
#+end_src 

Download the [raw] image file ~battle.png~ from GitHub

#+begin_src bash
  wget tinyurl.com/2s3f3t9c -O battle.png -o log
  file battle.png
#+end_src 

The new ~file~ command provides file type information. It should tell
you that ~bpmn.org~ is a ~text~, and that ~battle.png~ is a ~PNG~ file.

* Simple and nested 'if' structures
** Overview and example

- ~If~ statement structure in C is very similar to pseudocode

- [[battle1]] is the C version of the pseudocode [[problem1]] from earlier.

     #+name: battle1
     #+begin_example C
     if (health <= 100)
       // drink health potion
     else
       //resume battle
     #+end_example

- Differences: condition needs /parentheses/; no "end if" statement

- The ~health~ check results in a /Boolean/ answer: ~true~ or ~false~
    - To run, the program needs a declaration of the ~health~ variable

- Multiple statements need to be included in braces

- Here is a version that will run. The variable has been initialized

     #+name: battle2
     #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output
       int health = 99;

       if (health <= 100) {
         // drink health potion
         printf("Drinking health potion!\n");
        }
        else {
          // resume battle
          printf("Resuming battle!\n");
        }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: battle2
     : Drinking health potion!

** Battle by numbers

   * The last version [[battle3]] below reads input from a file.

     #+name: battleinput
     #+begin_src bash :results silent
       echo "1" > ../src/drink
     #+end_src

   * We only have two simple if structures, and no nesting.

     #+name: battle3
     #+begin_src C :tangle battle.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :cmdline < drink :results output
       int response = 0; // initialize response

       puts("\n\tIn-Battle Healing\n\n1:\tDrink health potion\n\n2:\tResume battle\n");

       printf("\nEnter your selection: ");
       scanf("%d", &response);

       if (response == 1)
         printf("\nDrinking health potion!\n");

       if (response == 2)
         printf("\nResuming battle!\n");

     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: battle3
     #+begin_example

	     In-Battle Healing

     1:	Drink health potion

     2:	Resume battle


     Enter your selection: 
     Drinking health potion!
     #+end_example

   * You can also tangle the file and run ~battle.c~ from the
     commandline:

     #+begin_example bash
       C-c C-v t
       gcc -o battle battle.c
       battle
     #+end_example

* Boolean algebra

  * [ ] What is algebra about?[fn:3]

  * Algebra allows you to form small worlds with fixed laws so that
    you know exactly what's going on - what the output must be for a
    given input. This certainty is what is responsible for much of the
    magic of mathematics.

  * Boole's (or Boolean) algebra, or the algebra of logic, uses the
    values of TRUE (or 1) and FALSE (or 0) and the operators AND (or
    "conjunction"), OR (or "disjunction"), and NOT (or "negation").

  * Truth tables are the traditional way of showing Boolean scenarios:

    #+name: AND
    | p     | q     | p AND q   |
    |-------+-------+-----------|
    | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE      |
    | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE     |
    | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE     |
    | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE     |

    #+name: OR
    | p     | q     | p OR q     |
    |-------+-------+-----------|
    | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE      |
    | TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE      |
    | FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE      |
    | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE     |

    #+name: NOT
    | p     | NOT p    |
    |-------+----------|
    | TRUE  | FALSE    |
    | FALSE | TRUE     |

  * Using the three basic operators, other operators can be built. In
    electronics, and modeling, the "exclusive OR" operator or "XOR",
    is e.g. equivalent to (p AND NOT q) OR (NOT p AND q)

    #+name: XOR
    | p     | q     | p XOR q | P = p AND (NOT q) | Q = (NOT p) AND q | P OR Q |
    |-------+-------+---------+-------------------+-------------------+--------|
    | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE    | FALSE             | FALSE             | FALSE  |
    | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE   | TRUE              | FALSE             | TRUE   |
    | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE   | FALSE             | TRUE              | TRUE   |
    | FALSE | FALSE | TRUE    | FALSE             | FALSE             | FALSE  |

  * XOR is the operator that we've used in our BPMN models for
    pseudocode as a gateway operator - only one of its outcomes can be
    true but never both of them

  * [ ] What is the result of each of the following expressions?

    | Expression        | Result |
    |-------------------+--------|
    | 3 == 3 AND 4 == 4 |TRUE    |
    |-------------------+--------|
    | 3 == 4 AND 4 == 4 |        |
    |-------------------+--------|
    | 4 == 3 OR 4 == 4  |        |
    |-------------------+--------|
    | NOT ( 4 == 4 )    |        |
    |-------------------+--------|
    | NOT ( 3 == 4 )    |        |
    |-------------------+--------|

  * Algebraic operations are more elegant and insightful than truth
    tables. Watch "Proving Logical Equivalences without Truth Tables"
    [[logic][(2012)]] as an example.

* Order of operator operations

  * In compound operations (multiple operators), you need to know the
    order of operator precedence

  * C has almost 50 operators. The most unusual are compound
    increment/decrement operators[fn:4]:

    | STATEMENT  | COMPOUND | PREFIX | POSTFIX |
    |------------+----------+--------+---------|
    | i = i + 1; | i += 1;  | ++i;   | i++;    |
    | j = j - 1; | j -= 1;  | --i;   | i--;    |

  * ++ and -- have side effects: they modify the values of their
    operands: ++i yields i+1 and increments i:

    #+name: prefix
    #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
      int i = 1;
      printf("i is %d\n", ++i);  // prints "i is 2"
      printf("i is %d\n", i);  // prints "i is 2"
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: prefix
    : i is 2
    : i is 2

    #+name: postfix
    #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
      int j = 1;
      printf("j is %d\n", j++);  // prints "j is 1"
      printf("j is %d\n", j);  // prints "j is 2"
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: postfix
    : j is 1
    : j is 2

  * Here is another illustration with an assignment of post and prefix
    increment operators:

    #+name: postfixprefix
    #+begin_src C :exports both :results output
      int num1 = 10, num2 = 0;
      puts("start: num1 = 10, num2 =0");

      num2 = num1++;
      printf("num2 = num1++, so num2 = %d, num1 = %d\n", num2, num1);

      num1 = 10;
      num2 = ++num1;
      printf("num2 = ++num1, so num2 = %d, num1 = %d\n", num2, num1);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: postfixprefix
    : start: num1 = 10, num2 =0
    : num2 = num1++, so num2 = 10, num1 = 11
    : num2 = ++num1, so num2 = 11, num1 = 11

  * The table [[order]] shows a partial list of operators and their
    order of precedence from 1 (highest precedence, i.e. evaluated
    first) to 5 (lowest precedence, i.e. evaluated last)

    #+name: order
    | ORDER | OPERATOR            | SYMBOL           | ASSOCIATIVITY |
    |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
    |     1 | increment (postfix) | ++               | left          |
    |       | decrement (postfix) | --               |               |
    |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
    |     2 | increment (prefix)  | ++               | right         |
    |       | decrement (prefix)  | --               |               |
    |       | unary plus          | +                |               |
    |       | unary minus         | -                |               |
    |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
    |     3 | multiplicative      | * / %            | left          |
    |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
    |     4 | additive            | + -              | left          |
    |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
    |     5 | assignment          | = *= /= %= += -= | right         |

  * Left/right associativity means that the operator groups from
    left/right. Examples:

    #+name: associativity
    | EXPRESSION | EQUIVALENCE | ASSOCIATIVITY |
    |------------+-------------+---------------|
    | i - j - k  | (i - j) - k | left          |
    | i * j / k  | (i * j) / k | left          |
    | -+j        | - (+j)      | right         |
    | i %=j      | i = (i % j) | right         |
    | i +=j      | i = (j + 1) | right         |

  * [ ] Make sure to write some of these out yourself and run
    examples. I found ~%=~ quite challenging: a modulus and assignment
    operator. ~i %= j~ computes ~i%j~ (i modulus j) and assigns it to
    ~i~.

    What is the value of ~i~ after running the code below?

    #+name: %=
    #+begin_src C :exports both
      int i = 10, j = 5;
      i%=j;
      printf("i was 10 and is now %d = 10 %% 5\n", i);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: %=
    : i was 10 and is now 0 = 10 % 5


  * [ ] Let's write a program [[compound_check]] to check the equivalence
    claimed in the table [[compound]].

    #+name: compound
    | OPERATOR | EXAMPLE | EQUIVALENT TO |
    |----------+---------+---------------|
    | +=       | a += b  | a = a + b     |
    | -=       | a -= b  | a = a - b     |
    | *=       | a *= b  | a = a * b     |
    | /=       | a /= b  | a = a / b     |
    | %=       | a %= b  | a = a % b     |

    #+name: compound_check
    #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
      int a = 10, b = 2;

      printf("10 += 2 is %d\n", a += b); a = 10; b = 2;
      printf("10 -= 2 is %d\n", a -= b); a = 10; b = 2;
      printf("10 *= 2 is %d\n", a *= b); a = 10; b = 2;
      printf("10 /= 2 is %d\n", a /= b); a = 10; b = 2;
      printf("10 %%= 2 is %d\n", a %= b);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: compound_check
    : 10 += 2 is 12
    : 10 -= 2 is 8
    : 10 *= 2 is 20
    : 10 /= 2 is 5
    : 10 %= 2 is 0


  * [ ] Using the table [[order]], parenthesize the following expression:

    #+name: simplify
    #+begin_example C
    a = b += c++ -d + --e / -f
    #+end_example

    Group 1:
    #+begin_example C
    a = b += (c++) -d + --e / -f
    #+end_example

    Group 2:
    #+begin_example C
    a = b += (c++) -d + (--e) / (-f)
    #+end_example

    Group 3:
    #+begin_example C
    a = b += ((c++) -d) + ((--e) / (-f))  // -,+ group from left to right
    #+end_example

    Group 4:
    #+begin_example C
    (a = (b += ((c++) -d) + ((--e) / (-f))))) // =, += group from right to left
    #+end_example

    Much better to write this like as a series of commands:
    #+begin_example C
    c++;  // c = c + 1
    e--;  // e = e - 1
    -f;   // f = -f
    c = c - d;
    e = e / f;
    b = b + c + e;
    a = b;
    #+end_example

* Compound if structures and input validation
** Booleans in C

   * C evaluates all non-zero values as TRUE, and all zero values as
     FALSE:

     #+name: boolean
     #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
       if (3) puts("3 is TRUE"); // non-zero expression
       if (!0) puts("0 is FALSE"); // !0 is literally non-zero
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: boolean
     : 3 is TRUE
     : 0 is FALSE
 
   * The Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT are represented in C by
     the logical operators ~&&~, ~||~ and ~!~, respectively

** ! operator

   * The ! operator is a "unary" operator that is evaluated from the
     left. It is TRUE when its argument is FALSE, and vice versa.

   * [X] If ~i = 100~, what is ~!i~?

   * [X] If ~j = 1.0e-15~, what is ~!i~?

   * Let's check!

     #+name: negation
     #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
       int i = 100;
       double j = 1.e-15;
       printf("!%d is %d because %d is non-zero!\n", i, !i, i);
       printf("!(%.1e) is %d because %.1e is non-zero!\n", j, !j, j);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: negation
     : !100 is 0 because 100 is non-zero!
     : !(1.0e-015) is 0 because 1.0e-015 is non-zero!

** && operator (logical AND)

   * Evaluates a Boolean expression from left to right

   * Value is TRUE if and only if both sides of the operator are TRUE

   * Examples:

     #+name: &&_op_true
     #+begin_src C :exports both
       if ( 3 > 1 && 5 < 10 ) // = TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE
         printf("The entire expression is true.\n");
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: &&_op_true
     : The entire expression is true.

     #+name: &&_op_false
     #+begin_src C :exports both
       if (!(3 > 5 && 5 < 5) ) // = NOT (FALSE AND FALSE) = TRUE
         printf("The entire expression (except the !) is false.\n");
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: &&_op_false
     : The entire expression (except the !) is false.

** || operator (logical OR)

   * Evaluates a Boolean expression from left to right

   * It is FALSE if and only if both sides of the operator are FALSE

   * It is TRUE if either side of the operator is TRUE

   * Examples:

     #+name: ||_op_true
     #+begin_src C :exports both
       if ( 3 > 5 || 5 == 5 ) // TRUE OR TRUE = TRUE
         printf("The entire expression is true.\n");
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: ||_op_true
     : The entire expression is true.

     Remember to use the logical comparison operator ==, and not the
     assignment operator =
     
     #+name: ||_op_false
     #+begin_src C :exports both
       if ( 3 > 5 || 6 < 5 ) { }// = FALSE OR FALSE = FALSE
        else printf("The entire expression is false.\n");
     #+end_src
     
   * Practice that using the GDrive notebook!

** Checking for upper and lower case

   * Characters are represented by ASCII[fn:5] character sets

   * E.g. ~a~ and ~A~ are represented by the ASCII codes 97 and 65,
     resp.

   * [ ] Let's check that.

     #+name: ascii_input
     #+begin_src bash :results silent
       echo "a A" > ascii
     #+end_src

     #+name: ascii
     #+begin_src C :cmdline < ascii :results output :export both
       char a, A;
       scanf("%c %c", &a, &A);
       printf("The ASCII value of %c is %d\n", a, a);
       printf("The ASCII value of %c is %d\n", A, A);
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: ascii
     : The ASCII value of a is 97
     : The ASCII value of A is 65

   * User-friendly programs should use compound conditions to check
     for both lower and upper case letters:

     #+name: ascii_both
     #+begin_example C
     if (response == 'A' || response == 'a')
     #+end_example

   * Practice that using the GDrive notebook!

** Checking for a range of values

   * To validate input, you often need to check a range of values

   * This is a common use of compound conditions, logical and
     relational operators

   * We first create an input file ~num~.

     #+name: valid_input
     #+begin_src bash :results silent
       echo 5 > num
     #+end_src

   * [ ] What does the code in [[validate]] do? Will it run? What will the
     output be for our choice of input?

     #+name: validate
     #+begin_src C :cmdline < num :exports both

       int response = 0;

       scanf("%d", &response);

       if ( response < 1 || response > 10 ) {
         puts("Number not in range.");
        } else {
         puts("Number in range.");
        }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: validate
     : Number in range.

   * Head to the practice notebook for some challenging exercises!

* The switch structure

  * The ~switch~ statement is fairly complex: it combines conditional
    expressions, constant expressions, default and break statements.

    #+begin_example C
    switch ( expression ) {
    case constant expression : statements
    ...
    case constant expression : statements
    default : statements
    }
    #+end_example

  1. *Controlling expression:* an integer expression in parentheses,
     like ~(5)~. Characters are treated as integers in C and cannot be
     tested, so ~('a')~ is not allowed.

  2. *Case labels:* each case begins with a constant expression, like
     ~Case 5:~ - this is like any other expression except that it
     cannot contain variables or function calls.

  3. *Statements:* any number of statements. No braces required around
     the statements. The last statement is usually ~break~ to close
     the case.

** Simple example

   * In the example code [[switch]], the ~grade~ is set in the variable
     declaration. Depending on the value, a ~case~ is triggered and
     the corresponding statements are executed.

   * [ ] What is the output of the code in [[switch]] for different
     values:
     | VALUE | OUTPUT        |
     |-------+---------------|
     |     5 | Failing       |
     |     3 | Passing       |
     |     0 | Illegal grade |
     |    -1 | Illegal grade |
     |   0.5 | Illegal grade |

     What does the program implement?

     #+name: switch
     #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
       int grade = 3;

       switch (grade) {
        case 4:
        case 3:
        case 2:
        case 1:
          printf("Passing");
          break;
        case 5:
        case 6:
          printf("Failing");
          break;
        default:
          printf("Illegal grade");
          break;
        }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: switch
     : Illegal grade

   * [ ] Q: Which problem/solution set does the program implement?

     #+begin_quote
     Answer: The program reflects "passing" grades 4,3,2,1, and "failing"
     grade 0. Any other grade value is not allowed. (This happens to be
     the European grade scale, which is A = 1 to D = 4, and F = 5 or 6.)
     #+end_quote

   * You can also put several case labels on the same line as in
     [[switch1]], which is otherwise identical to [[switch]].

     #+name: switch1
     #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
       int grade = 3;

       switch (grade) {
        case 4: case 3: case 2: case 1:
          printf("Passing");
          break;
        case 5: case 6:
          printf("Failing");
          break;
        default:
          printf("Illegal grade");
          break;
        }
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS: switch1
     : Passing

   * Note: You cannot write a case label for a range of values.

   * The default case (when none of the case expressions apply) is
     optional, and it does not have to come last.

** The role of the ~break~ statement

   * The ~switch~ statement is a controlled jump. The case label is
     but a marker indicating a position within the switch.

   * [ ] Let's run the previous program again, without the ~break~
     statements. What do you think the output will be?

     #+name: switch2
     #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
       int grade = 3;

       switch (grade) {
        case 4:
        case 3:
        case 2:
        case 1:
          printf("Passing");
        case 5:
        case 6:
          printf("Failing");
        default:
          printf("Illegal grade");
        }
     #+end_src

   * [ ] What happens without the ~break~ statements?

     #+begin_quote
     Answer: When the last statement in a case has been executed,
     control falls through to the first statement in the following
     case; its case label is ignored. Without ~break~ (or some other
     jump statement, like ~return~ or ~goto~, control flows from one
     case to the next.
     #+end_quote

   * Deliberate falling through (omission of ~break~) should be
     indicated with an explicit comment.

   * Let's practice - head over to switch.org in GDrive for some
     exercises.
