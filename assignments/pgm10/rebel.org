* Program assignment No. 10 - Fibonacci Series

- A Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where each number is the
  sum of the previous two numbers in the series. (i.e. 0 1 1 2 3
  5....).

- Write a C program that puts the first ~30~ numbers of the Fibonacci
  series into an /array/ and then prints them out.

- Use the Org-mode file fibonacci.org (GitHub) as a template and
  simply work through the file step by step and submit the completed
  file.

- In this exercise, you will once again use the ~noweb~ option to insert
  pre-defined code blocks into other code blocks to build up a program
  step by step. This is a precursor to object-oriented programming,
  and it is also a literate programming technique.

- The exercise includes 3 optional bonus challenges each worth 10
  points.

* Org-mode code block and header options

1) Add a title and an author header line with "pledged".

2) Add an Emacs Org-mode file header line ~#+PROPERTY:~

3) Add the following options to the Org-mode file header line:
   #+begin_example
   C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :tangle fibonacci.c :results output
   #+end_example

4) Once you created the line, run it with ~C-c C-c~ so that the
   settings are applied to the whole Org-mode file.

5) Make your own code block below this line, and print "~Hello World~"
   to make sure the setup works. Name the code block ~hello_world~.

----- put code here -----
#+BEGIN_SRC C
puts("NO");
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: NO


* Pseudo code

1) Write the pseudo code for the Fibonacci series program.

2) Use an ~example~ block (Org template: ~<e TAB~) and name it.

3) Tip: the Fibonacci series needs to be initialized with the first
   two elements of the series, ~fibo[0]=0~ and ~fibo[1]=1~.

4) Tip: write (incomplete) code next to the pseudo code like so:

   #+begin_example
     declare array of n elements  // fibo[n]
   #+end_example

----- put code below this line -----
#include<iostream>
arr[n] //size n is for generality
arr[0]=0;
arr[1]=1; // seed the array with the initial values

//use for because function has a known number of iterations
for( i=2 -> sizeof(arr)){
arr[i] = arr[i-1]+arr[i-2] //sums the previous two and assigns it the current location
cout<< arr[i]<<std::endl
}

* Declarations

1) Copy the code block you created above and yank it, or create a
   new C code block named ~declarations~.

2) You will need to declare an /integer array/ ~fib~ of size ~30~ and an
   integer variable ~i~ for looping purposes.

3) Make your code block below and run it with ~C-c C-c~ to make sure it
   is syntactically correct. Since there is no output, add ~:results
   silent~ to the header arguments.

----- PUT CODE BELOW THIS LINE -----
#+name:CHEESE
#+BEGIN_SRC C
fib[30];
int a,b;
#+END_SRC
* Initialization

1) Create a new code block named ~initialize~ below, and add the header
   options ~:results silent~ and ~:noweb yes~.

2) In the code block, write ~<<declarations>> in the first line. When
   you run this code block, the block [[declarations]] will be inserted.

3) You will need to assign the first two numbers of the Fibonacci
   series to the array. This gives the computer the starting point to
   start from. Remember as stated above the Fibonacci series is a
   series of numbers where every number is the sum of the previous two
   numbers.

----- PUT CODE BELOW THIS LINE -----
#+name: init
#+BEGIN_SRC C :results silent :noweb yes
<<declarations>>
#+END_SRC
* Loop over array

1) Create a new code block named [[loop]] below, and add the header
   options ~:results silent~ and ~:noweb yes~.

2) In the code block, write ~<<initialize>>~ in the first line. When you
   run this code block, the block [[initialize]] will be inserted. Notice
   that this includes both the declarations and the initialization.

3) Now write the main loop to compute the Fibonacci numbers for the
   entire array ~fib[30]~.

----- put your code below this line -----

* Print and check results

1) The array ~fib~ should now hold the first 30 Fibonacci numbers: $0,
   1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987,
   1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393,
   196418, 317811, 514229$.

2) Print your numbers. The output should look like this:

   #+begin_example
   The first N = 30 Fibonacci numbers:
   fib[ 0] = 0
   fib[ 1] = 1
   fib[ 2] = 1
   ...
   fib[10] = 55
   ...
   #+end_example

3) Import the code block [[loop]] in the final code block as shown
   below. You only have to add the printing statements.

4) Run the block and include the results in your submission.

   #+name: pgm:fibonacci
   #+begin_src C :noweb yes :results output
     <<loop>> // includes: [[declarations]] and [[initialize]]
     ...
     ...
   #+end_src
#+name:sauce
#+BEGIN_SRC C
 /* THIS IS FOR PART THREE
int n;
scanf("%d",&n);
int fib[n];
*/
 //size n is for generality
  int fib[30];
  // seed the array with the initial values
  fib[0]=0;
  fib[1]=1;
  int i; 
 //use for because loop  has a known number of iterations

  for(i=2; i < sizeof(fib)/sizeof(fib[0]);i++){

    //sums the previous two and assigns it the current location
    fib[i] = fib[i-1]+fib[i-2];
   }
 /* for(i=0;i < sizeof(fib);i++){
    printf("%d",fib[i]);
   }*/

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: sauce

* Bonus challenge 1 - check result

1) Compare your result them with the correct Fibonacci sequence, which
   is stored [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cc101/piHome/7_arrays/src/fibonacci][in GitHub as fibonacci]] - download: [[https://tinyurl.com/4djnkr6h][tinyurl.com/4djnkr6h]].

2) You have to read the file into your computer using ~scanf~ and then
   compare two arrays element by element.

3) Tip: use an ~IF...ELSE~ or ~SWITCH...CASE~~ selection statement to
   perform the check.
#+BEGIN_SRC C :cmdline < fibb :noweb yes
      <<sauce>>
    <<printarr>>
      int ans[30];
      for(i=0; i < 30; i++){
	scanf("%d,", &ans[i]);
      }
     for(i=0; i<30;i++){
     if(fib[i] != ans[i]){
       printf("wrong %d",i);
       break;
     }
     else(){puts("youre a genius");}
    }

    printarr(ans,30);

* Bonus challenge 3 - variable array length

As a bonus challenge (10 points), generalize your final program to
allow to input the array length ~N~ so that you could, e.g. compute the
first ~N~ Fibonacci numbers. Add the complete program as a code block
below, and include a sample result for ~N=35~.

----- Put code below this line -----
//already did this for the declaration of my first code block the for loop can take an array of any
size and fill it with the fibb sequence
* printarr()
  #+name:printarr
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
	    // I REFUSE TO WRITE THAT MANY FOR LOOPS 
	    // in rebellion i have written a print function
	    void printarr(int arr[],int size){
	      int i;
	      for(i = 0; i < size; i++){

		printf("Fib[%d]==%d ",i,arr[i]);
		if(i % 6 == 0 && i != 0 )
		  {printf("\n");}
	      }	  
	    };
