  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[./notes.org][notes.org]] file.
